Very simple game using Spring MVC and AngularJS. And to make the execution even simpler, it's using Spring Boot.

To execute it, 3 possible options:

- mvn spring-boot:run
- java jar target/stones-game-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war
- executing the main in Application.java

To play:

http://localhost:8080

Future improvements. Could be plenty of, but the main ones are:

- Allow playing in different computers. It's not really difficult.
- Implement the State Design Pattern instead of using all this checks for the GameState
- The Design of the view could be much much better.
- 1000 more changes.
